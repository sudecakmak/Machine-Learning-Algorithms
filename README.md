# Decision Algorithms

> ***Decision tree*** is a structure that contains nodes and edgesand is built from a dataset (table of columns representing features/attributes and rows corresponds to records). Each node is either used to make a decision (known as decision node) or represent an outcome (known as leaf node).

> ***Dataset*** is a collection of various types of data stored in a digital format.
